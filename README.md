## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- Using [footer] element instead of [div] excludes the section from being a d-flex item
- Strenghtened my knowledge in CSS -- especially aligning items with `display: flex;` --

### Continued development

From the beginning I've known my lack of knowledge in CSS, yet with some libraries like bootstrap, I thought I could ignore such downside. Yet I have turned back from a mistake. I am here to hone this skill and try to have in-depth information as possible.
